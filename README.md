# Gophercises by Jon Calhoun

Started going through the gophercises, [Go exercises by Jon Calhoun](https://github.com/gophercises), to learn more and keep my mind occupied.

Trying to go through the exercises by given instructions without peeking solutions.

Later will include the solutions from author of gophercises.
