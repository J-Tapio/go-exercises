# Quiz Game

[Exercise details @ Github](https://github.com/gophercises/quiz)

## Notes

Learn more about go package flags to include flags for timelimit and if the questions should be shuffled before starting the quiz.
With flag implementation command to run the application would require also flag for timelimit and if the questions should be shuffled.

Mainly used `fmt.Scanln` to read standard input text for time limit and question answers. I guess that better solution available.

While doing the task, out of curiosity, learned also how to colorise standard output text. Gives little bit better experience on how well quiz went.
