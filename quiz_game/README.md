## Notes

Learn more about go package flags to include flags for timelimit and if the questions should be shuffled before starting the quiz.

Mainly used `fmt.Scanln` to read standard input text for questions. Maybe better solutions out there.

While doing the task, out of curiosity, learned also how to colorise standard output text. Gives little bit better experience on how well quiz went.
